> Governance frameworks are the structure of an organization and reflect the interrelated relationships, factors, and other influences upon the institution. [More information](https://www.prometheusproject.net/governance/)

Governance frameworks structure and delineate power and the governing or management roles in an organization, set rules, procedures, and other informational guidelines, and define, guide, and provide for enforcement of these processes. 
These frameworks are shaped by the 
- Goals
- Strategic mandates
- Financial incentives
- Established power structures and processes of the organization. 

The organization of the governance framework is important for the success of the organization meeting its goals.

## Council's role in governance
In developing a governance operating model, the Prometheus Council balances competing goals (such as the pursuit of growth and the preservation of assets), defines responsibilities, and allocates resources to implementing governance. 

The Prometheus governance operating model is created to assist in fulfilling governance roles, enabling the Council to organize the governance structure and the mechanisms by which governance is implemented.

Council members are responsible for advancing the mission of the Prometheus Project. Duties include Monthly voting, Overseeing the documentation of agendas and minutes, Weekly meeting attendance, and Annual roadmap development.

## Prometheus governance functions
Prometheus governance serves several important functions, including:
1. Organizes operational, financial, risk management, and reporting processes such that the Council receives the information it requires to effect good governance and can conduct their activities in ways that comply with regulations and serve strategic ends.
2. Brings Prometheus governance framework down to the level of roles, responsibilities, reporting lines, and communications
3. Helps people to answer questions such as, “Why are we doing this?” “Is this okay?” “Whose call is this?” and “Who do we need to tell about this?” and to know when to ask such questions.
4. Sustains governance by creating a feedback loop in which the Council can identify and respond to new business, operational, competitive, and regulatory needs.
